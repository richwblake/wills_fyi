        <h3>This version includes a basic portfolio site with simplistic styling. I will use this site to maintain a blog, which will be the majority of content on this site.</h3>
        <h3>Along with basic information about me, there is a link to my resume (cv). The embedded live resume is hosted by Google. You can also download it from this server if you would prefer, by clicking 'download pdf' on the cv page.</h3>
        <h3>This site is built using the Sinatra framework provided by RubyGems. Additionally, this web application is hosted by Digital Ocean, and served using Passenger and Nginx. Please see my blog where I go on endlessly about all of it. Thank you for visiting, and please see my CV attached in pdf format at the corresponding link.</h3>
